## About

From May to August 2023 as people attending R Project Sprint 2023 we were offered the chance to participate in a C book club with the goal of gaining a basic understanding of C and how it interfaces with R.

Access the book club's materials in [this repository](https://github.com/r-devel/c-book-club).

## My presentation

I loved the book club, how it was organized, and how easy was to participate, even though the book itself, [Modern C](https://gustedt.gitlabpages.inria.fr/modern-c/) by Jens Gustedt, was very challenging to follow. I led the session 4's discussion with [a presentation](https://mcnanton.quarto.pub/c-book-club-for-r-contributors/#/title-slide=) on C library functions, style, organization & documentation.
