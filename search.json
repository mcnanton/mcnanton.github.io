Although I had participated as an organizer or speaker in the 2021 and 2022 (virtual) editions of LatinR, this was my first year attending the event in person, since the last in-person edition of the conference was in 2019, in Chile.\nWhat I particularly highlight from this edition of the conference is the opportunity to meet and exchange ideas in person with RLadies from different parts of Latin America, as well as with many public sector workers from various municipal and national entities who regularly use R to solve problems.\nI was also able to help on the organizing committee, moderate a discussion panel on the use of Shiny in the public sector, and assisting in the delivery of a workshop.\n\n\n\nFoto: Comunicación FCEA\n\n\nYanina Bellini, one of LatinR’s chairs, wrote a great post on this edition of LatinR."

Verde Arregoitia.\nHelping in the workshop was a great experience: the attendees had many questions, some related to the tidymodels framework in general, and others regarding conceptual aspects of machine learning.\nAccess the workshop’s materials here"

    "text": "Abstract\nHate speech found in social media a place to flourish. In the Argentinean context, new right-wing parties have disrupted the political arena, winning the elections of 2023. Many of these new right-wing figures grew in popularity due to their use of social media, on a background of increasing political violence. In this article, we use quantitative and qualitative tools to investigate the prevalence of hate speech targeting women politicians and analyze the role of different political affiliations in promoting such discourse. Furthermore, we propose a model that predicts users’ political alignments based on their profile descriptions, allowing us to explore the distribution of hate speech among different political orientations. Our results provide a descriptive account of the relationship between hate speech by politicians and other users and shows that right-wing political figures and supporters are strong emissors of hate speech, while women, especially those from the left-wing are more prone to receive violent content."
