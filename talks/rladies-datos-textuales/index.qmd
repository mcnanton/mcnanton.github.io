Over 60 people joined R-Ladies Buenos Aires' workshop where I taught how to visualize text data.

In the workshop, we went over common steps in text data analysis and created visualizations using the ggplot2 and wordcloud2 libraries using a corpus of poems by the Chilean poet [Gabriela Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriela_Mistral).

We planned the workshop as a part of "**30 Days of Graphics**" a virtual event promoted by @R4DS_es, held on Twitter to commemorate the birth of Florence Nightingale, a pioneer in data visualization.
