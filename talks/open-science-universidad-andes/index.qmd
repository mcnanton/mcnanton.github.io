Sabrina López, José Luis Villca Villegas, and I shared [MetaDocencia’s](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/) work virtually at the **University of Los Andes** in Colombia. This was the first of a two-part virtual series on **Open Science** and NASA’s [Transform to Open Science](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/) program in collaboration with the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).

We shared our experience contextualizing the materials for our virtual cohorts and walked through the syllabus of our [ALTa Ciencia Abierta](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/alta-ca/1-2024/) training. 
The attendees were very interested, and we received many questions about how to join future editions of the training.
