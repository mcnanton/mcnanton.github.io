The ALTa Ciencia Abierta course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to open science practices, focusing on key topics like reproducible research, open data, and collaborative workflows, for Spanish-speaking communities. It aims to equip researchers with the tools and knowledge to make their work more transparent, accessible, and reproducible.

During 2024, I had the pleasure of teaching the module on **open tools** in the three editions of the course, alongside [Mariela Rajngewerc](https://www.metadocencia.org/authors/mrajngewerc/). In this module, we explored tools for working openly with datasets, code and papers, ensuring that research processes remain open, reproducible, and easy for others to follow.

This course is part of a broader initiative supported by NASA - NASA TOPS - which promotes open science and collaboration across the global research community. MetaDocencia’s participation in this initiative is a significant step towards fostering a more inclusive and transparent scientific community, ensuring that research is accessible and reproducible for everyone, regardless of location or resources.
