In our talk “Become an R Contributor: Contributing translations to R base” with Paola Corrales we presented the process of adding translations to R base via weblate. 
We introduced attendees to how the [R Contributing working group](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group) works and guided the participants on [how to make their first R translation contribution to the language](https://contributor.r-project.org/rdevguide/chapters/message_translations.html#how-to-contribute-new-translations).
