Along with **R en Baires** we co-organized and launched a book club for **Mastering Shiny** by Hadley Wickham. The goal of this initiative was to explore a selection of chapters from the book alongside the local community through a series of virtual events open to Spanish speakers worldwide.

In each session, one or more speakers present the key points of the assigned chapters and their solutions to the exercises. 

For the first session, together with Jesica Formoso, we covered the first two chapters of the book: "Your First Shiny App" and "Basic UI".
