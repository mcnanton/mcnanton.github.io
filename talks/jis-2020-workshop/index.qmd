We developed and delivered an introductory workshop to Data Science for physicians and decision-makers as part of the **Health Informatics Conferece** organized by the [Health Informatics Department](https://www.linkedin.com/in/informaticaensalud/) of the Italian Hospital of Buenos Aires.

The goal of the workshop was to conduct a collaborative exercise within the framework of evidence-based decision-making, focusing on the dimensions and stages involved in the process of access, use, and interpretation of data.
