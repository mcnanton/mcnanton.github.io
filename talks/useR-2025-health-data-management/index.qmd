## About our talk

![](useR1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

The Health Information and Statistics Office within the Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires, Argentina, faced some key and unexpected challenges in its first year as an organization. As a small, 10-person team formed in 2019 building slow-paced data products with self-imposed goals, such as dashboards, they were hit with difficult tasks to be performed under pressure such as managing information and statistics flows during a pandemic for a city with 3M inhabitants and serving hundreds of physicians and decision-makers of the public sector with almost real-time information.

Over the years, the team has tripled in size and has played a key role in high-impact strategic data science projects. These include developing data science solutions for extracting information from free-text data, creating complex algorithms for processing data from the city's Electronic Health Records, and implementing large-scale cost recovery initiatives in the healthcare system by cross-referencing massive datasets and generating +35k rendered documents per week shared with key agencies in the city.

To fulfill these objectives, our team has built a robust infrastructure and a wide range of digital products—all within the R ecosystem.

The talk covers the strategies, tools, and lessons learned in building efficient and reproducible data workflows in the public sector in a context of very limited resources, and we explore how R has been fundamental in transitioning from individual analyses to scalable, automated workflows.
